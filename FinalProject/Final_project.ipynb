    "The final assignment is a neural network competition. Your task is to classify categories of clothing on the Fashion-MNIST data set, which has recently been proposed as a more challenging alternative to the standard MNIST dataset. For a more detailed description, some illustrations of the categories, reasons why Fashion-MNIST might be a better benchmark dataset than the classic MNIST dataset, and more, you can check [their GitHub](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). \n",
    "\n",
    "The competition is set up as an InClass competition [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/t/de281a20013a41a3ab724ec020848e23). If you want to continue following the machine learning direction, Kaggle is a great platform for training skills on real-world problems. Via our Kaggle InClass competition, you will be provided with a training and a validation dataset for your own (local) use, and with the features of the competition test set, for which you will generate predictions top be submitted to Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide a code basis which loads the dataset, trains a simple model, and writes the competition test set predictions into the file `test_set_predictions.csv`. This is the file you will create with your own model, and that you should submit to the competition website. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test dataset that we provide you with, contains approximately 42% of the actual total test data we have. The leaderboard will, during the competition, show the performance of your model on this 42% split. Please note, that the final results will be based on the other 58%. This means that overfitting the provided test dataset using the leaderboard will highly likely result in a poor performance on the final evaluation. This also means that the final standings may be different. The final evaluation will be performed after the deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the final evaluation, the Top 6 project groups will earn the following bonus on their assignment grades (and eternal fame): \n",
    "1. **Top 1 and 2** will receive +1.0 on their overall assignment grade. \n",
    "1. **Top 3 and 4** will receive +0.5 on their overall assignment grade. \n",
    "1. **Top 5 and 6** will receive +0.3 on their overall assignment grade. \n",
    "*(Note that the maximum average assignment grade you can reach is 10)*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think that it is necessary you can implement and run your model in a normal Python script, however you need to paste the finalized code including the exercises in this notebook **inside this notebook**. Thus, this final assignment is nothing more than the other assignments: you submit a single notebook file to Blackboard before the deadline, and the assignment counts as the last assignment in the list of all assignments.
